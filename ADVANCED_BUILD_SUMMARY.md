### 5. Package.json Updates

Added 11 new scripts:

- `build:advanced` - Production build with advanced script
- `build:dev` - Development build
- `build:watch` - Watch mode
- `build:esbuild` - esbuild bundler
- `build:esbuild:watch` - esbuild watch mode
- `docker:build` - Build Docker image
- `docker:run` - Run container
- `docker:up` - Start Compose services
- `docker:down` - Stop Compose services
- `clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `clean:all` - Deep clean

## 🔒 Security Features

### Docker Security

- Non-root user in containers
- Minimal Alpine-based images
- Multi-stage builds to reduce attack surface

- dumb-init for proper signal handling

### CORS Security

- Restricted to specific domains (cyberai.network, localhost)
- Configurable via environment variables
- No wildcard origins in production

### Rate Limiting

- API endpoint rate limiting (10 req/s with burst)
- Configured in nginx reverse proxy

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Tests Passing

- ✅ 22 integration tests for build system
- ✅ TypeScript type checking
- ✅ ESLint validation
